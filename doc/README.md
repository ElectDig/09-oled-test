#   Project 09-oled-test

  Electronica Digital - Austral 2023 - EAM
    
##   Test of OLED 0.96" display

  Using ESP32 development board

### Hardware

 1 OLED display 0.96"
 Jumper wires

###  Connections

 Connect OLED GND to GND  
 Connect OLED VCC to 3.3V  
 Connect OLED SCL to GPIO22  
 Connect OLED SDA to GPIO21  

 **Improtant note**: all OLED 0.96" have 4 connections but they have not the same position; please, look carefully

###  Verification

  Tests all modes of graphic display

  A good introductory explanation to SSD1306 used in conjuction with ESP32

  [ESP32 OLED Display with Arduino IDE](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-ssd1306-oled-display-arduino-ide/)

  It is written for ESP8266 but it is a very good explanation of OLED little displays and the library call usage

### Videos

  A very detailed video, but it is a long one (aprox. 40 minutes)
